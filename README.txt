Gluttony
========

Gluttony is a tool for finding dependency relationships among Python 
prjects in PyPi, it is based on `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_.

Installation
============

To install Gluttony

::

    easy_install Gluttony

Drawing Graph
=============

To know dependency relationships

::

    gluttony <project name> --display-graph

For example: you want to know the dependency relationships of a 
Python project `Sprox <http://sprox.org/>`_, then you can type::

    gluttony sprox --display-graph

The result might looks like this:

Also, it also supports most of command of ``pip install``, for example: 
you want to know the relations among `TurboGears2 <http://turbogears.org/>`_ packages, here we type

::

    gluttony -i http://www.turbogears.org/2.0/downloads/current/index tg.devtools --display-graph

The result:

Oops, the graph is a mess.  I didn't handle layout of graph.  I have not time 
to finish it right now.  Fortunately, you can output the graph as dot or 
pickle format file for further handling.

Output Dot File
===============
Fortunately, if you want to get the 
relationships data in Python form, this tool also provide a pickle output. 
For example:

::

    gluttony sprox --pydot sprox.dot
	
Then you can use `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ for drawing beautiful 
graph. Like this one:

Another huge example:

`Dependency relationship digram of TurboGears2 <http://static.ez2learn.com/gluttony/tg2_dot.png>`_

Output Pickle File
==================
If you want to get the relationships data in Python form, this tool also 
provide a pickle output. For example:

::

    gluttony sprox --pickle sprox.pickle
	
Then you can use pickle.load for further processing.
